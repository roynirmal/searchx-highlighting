## Minutes of meeting:

### The choice of task for our study:
- Essays are good for evaluating learning and it is also cognitively higher than recall based vocabulary learning
- However, in our studies, under the given setup, users are not motivated to write the essays and it is difficult to evaluate them even with Wilson and Wilsons' rubrics. 
- Moreover, the users need a lot to invest to write an essay and hence they might not properly reproduce what they have learned. By evaluating the essays, thus, we run the risk of evaluating how they write instead of what they have learned.
- Nonetheless, with the notepad and access to highlights we are actually making life easier for the users to spend more effort to write the essay. 

### Options moving forward:
1. Go through the TU Delft MOOC data dump from previous study and assign Bloom's taxonomy to the exercises so that we can have different exercises assessing different level of learning. Use Ujwal's [example questionnaire](https://sites.google.com/view/searchquestionshypertext19/questions) from his HyperText paper as reference/inspiration/motivation.
**Challenge** - We have to make sure through priming/task description that users search topics/aspects from which we ask the questions in the post test. Otherwise, they might learn something else which we are not able to capture.
2. Use essays as task or asking them to create outline etc. 
**Challenge** - Other than what is mentioned previously, we run the risk of evaluating how well they copy-paste stuff (information extraction) instead of what htey actually learned. It is nice to know the information extraction capabilities and how it is affected by the tools but we have to definitely evaluate learning as well.
3. Create our own tasks. **Challenge** - Create our own task


### Why are they highlighting what they are highlighting?
1. Have two different colours? **Cons** - too much visual/cognitive overload for users. might be a counter-intuitive way of highlighting for some users. 
2. Have a small pop-up after they highlight allowing them to mark why they highlighted something. They can later sort by the tags. **Cons** - development effort?
3. Post test questionnaire about highlighting strategies. **Cons** - We don't have enough granularity as to why they highlight particular sentences only a summarisation

### Other pointers:
- Recall test after a few days
- Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for post questionnaire when we ask them if they found highlighting/note-taking useful.
